# TFR-Checker
A python code that periodically checks the FAA's TFR Website so SpaceX don't have to manually check the page every 20 minutes on Starship launch days
You need to install win10toast for windows notifications to work, otherwise simply remove all lines related to this and you'll still receive a print to console for changes
to start (unless you want a notifcation for all tfr's that are currently up) type check(get_current_Tfrs()) into console
